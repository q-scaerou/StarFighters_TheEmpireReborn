# Star_Fighters_The_Empire_Reborn

## This game was made By [Sampedro Cyril](https://github.com/SampedroCyril) and Scaerou Quentin.

Part of a contest (that we won!) during our training in JAVA JEE, we worked 3 weeks on this project.
All the graphic items (player and enemies sprites, background, shots,...) are generated procedurally, by using HTML canvas and lots of JavaScript methods.

The game music is also customized. We used the website Beepbox to create our own 8-bit game theme.

All the physics and functionalities of the game have been implemented with the use of Phaser 2.2.1 Danabar. It took us a lot of efforts to understand and then adapt this library to our needs.

It was our first project and we're very proud of the result we managed to produce.

I hope you will enjoy playing [Star Fighters](https://q-scaerou.github.io/StarFighters_TheEmpireReborn/) :)
